# FULL STACK DEVELOPER TEST
Workhouse Advertising

## Background
This application demonstrates my ability to create an api with Laravel and a frontend in Vue.js to consume that api.  I created the application according to the [task requirements](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZEfBMXZebxwnltmXoyc8ORxFa19dkULXiRy) and added some additional funcionality. 

## Additional features
### Backend 
I wrote some tests in *tests/Feature/PropertyDataTest.php* which can be run with `php artisan test` in the root  directory. 
### Frontend
Clicking on an image preview opens into a full page modal
